Web accessbility

Web accessibility means anybody with disabilities or without disabilities
can access the web application. Web is an increasingly important resource
in many aspects of life: government information, education resources,
news or many more. So we should make web accessible to provide equal acess
and equal opportunity to people with disabilities.

First step to understand how people with disabilities use the web.
How blind people use screen reader to interact with web.
How people use joystick to interact with web
Mouth stick
Some people use text-to-speech app

some people think accessbility is just a checklist.
Digital information be accessible and well coded.

Important points:
- Page title is very important because we have multiple tabs open. It helps 
to understand where on the web they are.

- Properly heading structure (h1, h2, h3 - h6) of the page. It helps to
understand the format of the information.

- Link text is very important. We should not use link with ("learn more", "click here")
or shortcut text.
We use like this "Signup for the family plan" "more information for family plan"

- Alt text important for image to understand it.

- List items properly align.

- Captions makes video accessible

- Provide proper space, font size, color contrast.

- Web focus is clearnly visible like button focus, link focus.
